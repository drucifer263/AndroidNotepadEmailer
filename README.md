# AndroidNotepadEmailer
a notepad app I made with a button to email the note to whoever so I dont have to copy and paste or screenshot my grocery list to send to Meghan because thats annoying... kinda in development/kinda done. 

pretty sure it works on everything 4.1 and up... maybe not.  It works on a Galaxy S7
